# Iris Clustering

This project focuses on clustering the Iris dataset using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features of Iris flowers, which will be used for clustering and data analysis. The project includes an implementation of clustering algorithms to classify the flowers into different species.

## Files Included

- **`iris.data`**: Contains the Iris dataset with class labels (species).
- **`test.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering algorithm and analysis.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARPurohit07/Iris-Clustering.git
